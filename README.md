# coding-adventures
Small projects I do in my spare time to experiment with the intersection of math and visual programming. Doing my own code adventures comes from my own interests as well as being heavily inspired by youtubers like [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) and [Freya Holmer](https://www.youtube.com/@Acegikmo)

Each python file is a single project of which im satisfied with its result. I've utilized pygame for the visualisation and it should therefore be the only library that is necessary to run each file.
